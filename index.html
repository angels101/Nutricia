      <h2 class="headline">Company History</h2>
      <p>In 2006, Nutricia  Foods founder <a href="#employees-AngelsCodex">Angels Codex</a> set out to create supplements and nutritional products made from the <em>purest ingredients</em> and backed by scientific and <em>performance data</em> – to provide a strong basis of <em>trust and accountability</em>.</p>
      <p>His quest began while training for his <em>first Community Nutrition Awareness</em>, after recovering from a <em>lengthy immune deficiency syndrome</em> that left him with residual aches, pains, and decreased physical performance. He yearned for <em>simple and natural ingredients</em>, in their purest form, instead of labels with <em>lengthy chemical names</em> and disclaimers. When no products lived up to his strict requirements, Arthur set his sights on <em>creating products</em> that catered to his own vision.</p>
      <p>Today that vision has become Nutricia Foods…offering a variety of <a href="#products">supplements, energy bars and rehydration solutions</a>. At the foundation of Foods are products backed by scientific and performance data.</p>
